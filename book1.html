<h2> Endorsements</h2>

<ul>

  <li> "My favorite machine learning book just received a face-lift!
    'Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction' is the most
    comprehensive and accessible book on modern machine learning by a
    large margin.  
    It now also covers the latest developments in deep learning and
    causal discovery. With this upgrade it will remain the reference
    book for our field that every respected researcher needs to have
    on their desk."  -- <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/">Max Welling</a>,
    U. Amsterdam 

    <li> "There are many books on machine learning out there, but none gives
    such a well-rounded, up-to-date, and comprehensive view of the
    field as this one. We use this book as reference reading for our
    students taking the advanced machine learning course at Oxford to
    introduce them to fundamental as well as current topics in the
    field. I'm amazed at the amount of work that went into this
    book---which will surely be used by many to train the next
      generation of machine learning experts."
